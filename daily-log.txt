DAILY LOG
This file will include my daily scrum report as I go through parts of this course with less exercises,
such as the section practicing GitHub techniques and learning about NPM scripts. I will answer the following
three questions each day:
1. What did you do today?
2. What will you do tomorrow?
3. Any complications?

7/20
1. Today I started this daily log to practice using the command line to add a new branch and make a
commit onto my GitHub project. I also the video about how to commit to open source projects on GitHub and made my first
commit onto an open source project.
2. Tomorrow I hope to complete the section on NPM and NPM scripts.
3. When committing to the open source project I had my first experience with a conflict while merging and had to go back to one
of the earlier videos to refresh how to resolve the conflict and add my changes to the master branch.
