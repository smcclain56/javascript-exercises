DAILY LOG
This file will include my daily scrum report as I go through parts of this course with less exercises,
such as the section practicing GitHub techniques and learning about NPM scripts. I will answer the following
three questions each day:
1. What did you do today?
2. What will you do tomorrow?
3. Any complications?

1. Today I started this daily log to practice using the command line to add a new branch and make a
commit onto my GitHub project. I also the video about how to commit to open source projects on GitHub and made my first
commit onto an open source project.
2. Tomorrow I hope to complete the section on NPM and NPM scripts.
3. When committing to the open source project I had my first experience with a conflict while merging and had to go back to one
of the earlier videos to refresh how to resolve the conflict and add my changes to the master branch.

1. Today I completed the section of the Udemy course on NPM and NPM scripts. I learned what NPM is, how to set it up and how to
install and use packages. I also learned more about the package.json file and what some of the keys mean; such as scripts,
dependencies and deep dependencies. I also understand the importance of updating packages because of security threats and how
to view those threats on GitHub.
2. Tomorrow I will be beginning the section on React.
3. I feel like a lot of the questions I had about NPM make much more sense after the lectures today. However, some of the new
stuff is still confusing to me and I am unsure how I will do when I am working on my own. For example, I feel like I understand
the newest way of importing files (WebPack + ES6) but I was confused in the video today when he had to use browserify instead
because I am less familiar with that method.
