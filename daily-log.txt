DAILY LOG
This file will include my daily scrum report as I go through parts of this course with less exercises,
such as the section practicing GitHub techniques and learning about NPM scripts. I will answer the following
three questions each day:
1. What did you do today?
2. What will you do tomorrow?
3. Any complications?

7/20
1. Today I started this daily log to practice using the command line to add a new branch and make a
commit onto my GitHub project. I also the video about how to commit to open source projects on GitHub and made my first
commit onto an open source project.
2. Tomorrow I hope to complete the section on NPM and NPM scripts.
3. When committing to the open source project I had my first experience with a conflict while merging and had to go back to one
of the earlier videos to refresh how to resolve the conflict and add my changes to the master branch.


7/21
1. Today I completed the section of the Udemy course on NPM and NPM scripts. I learned what NPM is, how to set it up and how to
install and use packages. I also learned more about the package.json file and what some of the keys mean; such as scripts,
dependencies and deep dependencies. I also understand the importance of updating packages because of security threats and how
to view those threats on GitHub.
2. Tomorrow I will be beginning the section on React.
3. I feel like a lot of the questions I had about NPM make much more sense after the lectures today. However, some of the new
stuff is still confusing to me and I am unsure how I will do when I am working on my own. For example, I feel like I understand
the newest way of importing files (WebPack + ES6) but I was confused in the video today when he had to use browserify instead
because I am less familiar with that method.

7/22
1. Today I created my first React project using the create-react-app NPM package. I also started turning this project into the
"Robofriends" project this course is having us make. I learned the basics of JSX and how to use classes or functions to render
React components on the webpage. I also created my git repo for this project and uploaded my files.
2. Tomorrow I hope to complete the second part of "Building a React App" section of the course which will include the next steps
of building "Robofriends"
3. I didn't have any complications today, I feel like I do understand the basic of React at the moment. However, I am having trouble
recalling some of the css I will need to style my React pages so I want to refresh that as well

7/23
1. Today I kept working on my React project. I created some smaller components and set up the App to use those components to make a
responsive search bar that filters the robots according to what the user searches. I also started working on some of the styling of
the application.
2. None
3. Some of the search bar code along with some of the react syntax was confusing to me in the lesson today

7/24
1. None
2. Tomorrow I hope to complete part 4 of the "create your first react project sequence" of the course and look through my code to
make sure I understand everything that has been done
3. None

7/25
1. Today I finished up the tutorial for my first react project by adding a scroll function, cleaning up the code, and separating the
files into different directories to make it easier to navigate through the code
2. Tomorrow I hope to fix a few CSS issues I've been having
3. The robot cards have been getting bigger when the name is longer and I can't get it so that each card stays as it's set size


7/26
1. Today I added the last few features to my React project and began the section on HTTP/JSON/AJAX/Asynchronous JavaScript. I learned
how HTTP requests work, why JSON and AJAX are so useful and what a "Promise" is and how to use them
2. Tomorrow I hope to complete the sections on Asynchronous Await and ES9 and hopefully start the section on the backend
3. I am still getting used the syntax of Promises and find them difficult to understand

7/27
1. Today I finished the section on HTTP/JSON/AJAX/Asynchronous JavaScript by learning how to use async await functions. I also completed
a short section which was an introduction to the back-end and API's
2. Tomorrow I want to refresh material
3. No complications

7/28
1. Today I took a break with learning new things so that I could refresh all the new material I learned in the React section by looking
over my Robofriends project and making sure I still understood the code
2. Tomorrow I want to complete the API exercise
3. No complications
